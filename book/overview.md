# Welcome

As a part of the eScience Institute's events and programming, we work with different scientific communities to author learning materials teaching data science and software engineering principles to a variety of audiences.

This book is kept as a record of these home-grown materials, as well as a select curation of external resources that we use regularly in our work. These materials are indexed in two different ways:

1. **By tutorial subject**, such that you can quickly find material about how to achieve a given task.
2. **By audience domain**, such that you can materials about data science written by authors in your (or a similar) field.

The content in these two indices is largely overlapping, but not exactly the same. For a more structured walkthrough of this content, please consider attending one of our [office hours](https://escience.washington.edu/office-hours/), [carpentries workshops](https://uwescience.github.io/carpentries/), or [hackweeks](https://guidebook.hackweek.io/mission.html).

[//]: # (TODO: find a good landing page for hackweeks)

We hope you find this index useful, and welcome [submissions](https://github.com/uwescience/Online-Educational-Resources/issues/new) from UW affiliates for new materials that you think should be included on this page.
